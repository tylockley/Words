First, I have to assume this question relates to the Christian God - being that, as an American, and Christianity being the dominant religion in America, the question is thus about the Christian God. So while I do believe in a higher, godly force, I do not believe in the Christian God or traditional Christianity. My religion &ndash; or rather, my spiritual belief &ndash; most closely resembles the ancient religion of Gnosticism. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">The Gnostic scholar, Stephan Hoeller, describes Gnosticism as a pre Christian sect that by today&rsquo;s standards would be outrageously blasphemous. Gnosticism blames the world&rsquo;s sufferings and failures on the creator, not mankind. &nbsp;To understand this stance, there are two creators that must be discussed. The first is the &lsquo;true God,&rsquo; and the second is the &lsquo;half-maker.&rsquo; Gnostics hold that there exists a higher force in the world from which </span><span class="c7">It </span><span class="c1">created all the substance of the world. From this, gods were created, of whom had the power to create worlds. &nbsp;Humans and the Earth were created by one of these gods. &nbsp;It is this god that the Christians (and virtually all other modern religions &ndash; since the core of every religion say the same thing) worship. &nbsp;Gnostics hold that &ldquo;humans mirror the duality found in the world: in part, it was made by the false creator God and in part, it consists of the light of the True God&rdquo; (Hoeller). &nbsp;Humans are ignorant of their true nature, and &ldquo;anything that causes us to remain attached to earthly things serves to keep us in enslavement to these lower cosmic rulers&rdquo; (Hoeller).</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">Salvation by a Gnostic standard implies a release from earthly things and a realization of the True God. &nbsp;This is achieved in part by an individual attempt, and by enlightenment rose within mutual human consciousness. &nbsp;Therefore, Gnostic values encourage non-attachment, non-conformity, lack of egotism, and respect for freedom. Salvation can additionally be achieved by aid from &ldquo;Messengers of the Light.&rdquo; &nbsp;The light is part of the True God. &nbsp;The Messengers are, amongst others, Jesus (Hoeller). &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c11"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">My essay aims to prove that I cannot be convinced to change my mind and believe in the Christian God. I find the following evidence to exemplify Christianity as weakly supported and the victim of manipulation and deception. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">In 2006, a Greek written text was found preserved in an Egyptian Cave, written sometime before AD 180. Once translated, it was revealed to be the Gospel of Judas. This book has the capacity to rewrite everything we know about Christianity. &nbsp;Traditionally, Judas is known to be the embodiment of evilness and the betrayer of Jesus. &nbsp;But this text says the opposite. Judas was Jesus&rsquo; closest friend and acted upon Jesus&rsquo; request to free him from his human body, a necessity Jesus would rather have done by a friend rather than an enemy. Judas was the one who understood Jesus&rsquo; true message...perhaps the message of the Light, if you will. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The story goes that Jesus asked his disciples to stand before him in spirit, of which only Judas did. &nbsp;Judas said to Jesus &ldquo;I know who you are and where you have come from. You are from the immortal realm of Barbelo. And I am not worthy to utter the name of the one who has sent you.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jesus then goes on to speak to Judas privately, telling him about a &ldquo;corruptible Sophia,&rdquo; that Judas will be cursed by future generations, and that there exists a &ldquo;great and boundless realm, whose extent no generation of angels has seen, in which there is a great invisible spirit.&rdquo; &nbsp;This invisible spirit is described as the &ldquo;Self-Generated.&rdquo; Jesus tells Judas about Nebro (or Yaldabaoth) and Saklas - Saklas, who &ldquo;said to this angel, &lsquo;let us create a human being&rsquo;.&rdquo; &nbsp;Jesus then asserts, &ldquo;truly, I say to you, Judas, those who offer sacrifices to Saklas (as) God -[three lines missing]- everything that is evil.&rdquo; &nbsp;Excerpts are taken from the Gospel of Judas, as translated by Rodolphe Kasser, Marvin Meyer, and Gregor Wurst. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">What or who is Barbelo, Sophia, Nebro, and Saklas? Gaye Strathearn from Brigham Young University enlightens us to Gnostic mysticism. The Supreme God is an unknowable being who created:</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c9">&ldquo;Complex series of male and female divine beings, beginning with Barbelo and followed by Autogenes who fill the Pleroma (the place where </span><span class="c9">the god</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;dwells) with light. &nbsp;One of the last of these beings is named Sophia. &nbsp;She falls from grace when she desires to create without her consort. &nbsp;The resulting creature is a defective being often identified as either Yaldabaoth (&ldquo;child of chaos&rdquo;) or Saklas (&ldquo;fool&rdquo;).&rdquo; (Strathearn, 30)</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The story continues that Saklas &ldquo;created the material world and entraps human souls in material bodies to prevent them from returning to the Pleroma&rdquo; (Strathearn, 30). &nbsp;It is Saklas who is the God in the Old Testament. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">W</span><span class="c9">e could go back and forth all day long citing old texts that prove this point or that to justify our different spiritual or religious beliefs. Religion is perhaps the most emotionally charged subject, so it is hard to dissociate facts from opinions. Additionally, all sides cite texts that are old and have been subjected to translation, damage, and political corruption for hundreds of years. </span><span class="c1">Stefan Lovgren from National Geographic claims that the Gospel of Judas &ldquo;denounced by orthodox Christian leaders and denounced entry into the Bible&rdquo; (Lovgren). &nbsp;Thus its exile to the cave. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Orthodox Christians interpret the Gospel of Judas to be &ldquo;based on erroneous translations and is essentially wrong&rdquo; (oca.org). &nbsp;It is regarded as a fabrication to support Gnostic beliefs and that Judas acted out of greed (since he was paid money and later committed suicide). Instead, Jesus needed to be betrayed so to &ldquo;assume the fullness of human life and suffering&rdquo; (oca.org). </span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Here I find a fallacy in Christianity. &nbsp;If one book &ndash; clearly written about Jesus and his disciples &ndash; is denounced as fabrication, then, logically, how can any of the other books in the Bible be accepted as fact? Why would the one book that challenges orthodox beliefs be denounced, but not any of the others that do support the acceptable approach to Christianity?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;Why is the controversial fictitious but the acceptable fact? &nbsp;These are ancient texts we are working with. &nbsp;They have been damaged by the elements and manipulated by man. &nbsp;I cannot say with absolute certainty that the Gospel of Judas or the Bible in its entirety is wholly true or false. These are ancient texts we are working with. They have been damaged by the elements and manipulated by man. The facts are largely based on the interpretations of stories. &nbsp;Therefore, my disbelief in Christianity and the Christian God is reassured by the denunciation of evidence that implies doubt to tradition.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">As a deeply spiritual person, I acknowledge that faith serves a higher purpose by providing people with solace and security. &nbsp;The mere inclination to believe that there is a sliver of hope in whatever abyss one find themselves in is a beautiful quality in humans. &nbsp;This is faith. &nbsp;Though for a logical discussion,</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;I reject faith as a justifiable basis for belief. I see faith as a means to end the philosophical discussion and further inquiry. It is easy for a believer to say: &ldquo;I cannot accept your (the &lsquo;non-believer&rsquo;s&rsquo;) premise that God doesn&rsquo;t exist because I have faith in Him.&rdquo; &nbsp;Faith is akin to disputing arguments as matters of opinions, not matters of fact. &nbsp;I am not saying that my spiritual belief is fact compared to others religious beliefs - it is my </span><span class="c7">opinion</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;that my spirituality is fact, just as it is a Christian&rsquo;s </span><span class="c7">opinion</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;that the Bible is fact. &nbsp;It can also go to say that the legitimacy of the Book of Judas is also a matter of opinion.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">To conclude my spiritual beliefs, I find that they can be made synonymous to Friedrich Nietzsche&rsquo;s assertion that man is god. &nbsp;For if the higher, true God of Gnosticism made all substances of itself, that would eventually transpire down to mankind. &nbsp;Therefore, it is my belief that we are all made of godliness from the highest realm.</span><span class="c11">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">Hoeller, </span><span class="c9">Stephan</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;A. &ldquo;The Gnostic Worldview: A Brief Summary of Gnosticism.&rdquo; The Gnostic Archive</span><span class="c7">, </span><span class="c13"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.gnosis.org&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1562436414704000">www.gnosis.org</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">Lovgren, Stefan. &ldquo;The Lost Gospel Revealed; Says Jesus Asked Judas to Betray Him.&rdquo; </span><span class="c7">Science and Innovation. </span><span class="c9">National Geographic, 6 Apr 2006, </span><span class="c13"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.nationalgeographic.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1562436414704000">www.nationalgeographic.com</a></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">&ldquo;The Gospel of Judas.&rdquo; </span><span class="c9">National</span><span class="c9">&nbsp;Geographic Society.

While I like to claim that I am deeply spiritual, I don&rsquo;t do near as much practicing as I&rsquo;d like. &nbsp;Gnosticism most closely resembles my beliefs, though I cannot proclaim to be gnostic. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d like to say wholeheartedly that I make no distinction between things we can physically sense and things we cannot physically sense. I&rsquo;d like to say this because I believe there is more than we perceive. &nbsp;However, I am still egotistical and very connected to my body. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">With that said, I think that non-physicality is more real because it implies answers to things we cannot explain. &nbsp;An example would be how planetary retrogrades can explain shifts in moods by changing gravitational pulls. &nbsp;Or, the gut instinct people get about things. &nbsp;Emotion is not physical. And what about dreams and dejavu? Thought is not physical, but it is thought and emotion that propels us. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">When I was younger, my favorite philosophers were the transcendentalists. &nbsp;I admired the solace they found in nature and simplicity. &nbsp;Ralph Waldo Emerson is regarded to have &ldquo;strongly believed the individual must have the courage to look into his own heart for spiritual guidance and trust his intuition&rdquo; (Merdut). &nbsp;This quote exemplifies my own belief of immaterialism. &nbsp;It is not through material riches that one receives wealth and inner peace. &nbsp;If one has less material objects to distract their mind from contemplation and intuitive listening, one can operate on a more efficient level. It will also create more room for other people. &nbsp;If more people were minimalists, the oceans wouldn&rsquo;t be filled with plastic.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Furthermore; Emerson says that &ldquo;once you make a decision, the universe conspires to make it happen&rdquo; (Merdut). &nbsp;This claim ties into non-physicality being more real because of metaphysics. &nbsp;I understand metaphysics to work like gravity. &nbsp;Everything has its own gravitational field because everything emits a frequency. &nbsp;These frequencies either have a positive charge or a negative charge. &nbsp;Just like protons and electrons, they are attracted to their same kind. &nbsp;Thus, the Law of Attraction. &nbsp;The Law of Attraction claims that if you think positive thoughts &ndash; as if you already have what you want &ndash; you will literally attract it. &nbsp;This effect is certainly not physical.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Therefore, I think science can discover ultimate reality. &nbsp;I think reality can best be explained metaphysically. &nbsp;After all, the way we view the world rests on an agreed perception. &nbsp;Like how Aldous Huxley showcased in &ldquo;The Doors of Perception,&rdquo; our image of ourselves and our world is only a construct that is stubborn, yet fragile. &nbsp;I contribute this to be the reason why religions war with each other &ndash; each is a threat to their perception of reality. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">I think Gnosticism coincides with metaphysics. The value they place on individual self-determination is in accordance with the Law of Attraction. &nbsp;And it is inevitable that by improving oneself, one&rsquo;s environments are improved. Positivity begets positivity. &nbsp;And since a gnostic purpose is to leave the physical world be rejoined with the &ldquo;True God,&rdquo; there must be another world &ndash; and it only makes sense for it to be non-physical. &nbsp;People cannot perceive it, because we are sensational. &nbsp;We are designed to feel things with our bodies, not our spirits. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">Thus, I do believe in an existence more real than this one. While I was researching psychedelic plants for a research paper, I came across several things that can be used to support this claim, the most interesting being the entheogenic properties of dimethyltryptamine (DMT). &nbsp;It is referred to by Rick Strassman (author of &ldquo;DMT: The Spirit Molecule&rdquo;) as the spirit molecule. &nbsp;The accounts from the users clearly demonstrate this. The experience is described to be one of a breakthrough into some sort of cosmic, other-worldly space. &nbsp;All accounts declared the space to be inhabited by some sort of entity that communicated with them visually. &nbsp;From the visuals, the user&rsquo;s felt profound mental and emotional clarity.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">The prevalence of natural psychedelics in the Americas and their molecular similarity explains the transcendent religious qualities of indigenous Amerindian cultures. Both scientific and religious aspects of psychedelic plants prove the existence of a state that is non-physical, though nonetheless real. &nbsp;The entheogenic qualities of these plants could very well be where the concept of heaven was originally derived from. &nbsp;If heaven is a place of, first, judgment, then forgiveness, and finally peace, it is akin to the psychedelic experience. Medicinally, the substances heal emotional discontent by making a user hyper-aware to their emotions and providing mental clarity by destructing stubborn perceptions. &nbsp;Medicinally, it is an unpleasant experience that can produce cognitive dissonance. &nbsp;Nothing was ever fixed by ignorance. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">My claim could be disputed as drug-induced delusion. &nbsp;Though I would contend that a lack of physical explanation inevitably leads to such doubt. Furthermore, we know that when a person dies, their spirit goes </span><span class="c7">somewhere</span><span class="c9">. &nbsp;Energy cannot just dissipate. &nbsp;Wherever it goes, it is not in a physical form. &nbsp;The same concept can be applied to DMT experiences, though to a lesser extent. &nbsp;Ultimately, a good reason to think about reality and the afterlife is to find whatever coincides most with one&rsquo;s intuition and peace. &nbsp;As long as someone can justify their beliefs on their own contemplation, reasoning, and researching, anything goes. It&rsquo;s their spirit that is at stake, not someone else&rsquo;s cognitive dissonance. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c1">Works Cited</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c9">Merdut, Flavial. &ldquo;23 Ralph Waldo Emerson Quotes to Become more Self-Reliant.&rdquo; Goalcast, 30 July 2018, </span><span class="c13"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.goalcast.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1562436414709000">www.goalcast.com</a></span><span class="c1">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c12"><span class="c0">Lin, Tao. &ldquo;DMT: You Cannot Imagine a Stranger Drug or a Stranger Experience.&rdquo; </span><span class="c0 c17">Tao of Terrence</span><span class="c0">, Vice, 5 Aug. 2014, </span><span class="c13"><a class="c3" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.vice.com&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1562436414709000">www.vice.com</a></span><span class="c0 c19">.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1"></span></p></body>
